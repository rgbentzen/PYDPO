## Positive Youth Development and Program Outreach Package

### Purpose 
An online awareness/training package for all Adults involved with the Canadian Cadet Movement to bring awareness to Youth issues such as bullying, addiction, depression, self-harm and more.  An additional component covers the methods of outreach for the program.  
The mandate of the package stems from the June 3, 2011 Speech from the Throne.  In it, the Government of Canada committed to all Canadians it “…will help at-risk youth avoid gangs and criminal activity.”

### Distribution
Bilingual, for National access 
- 7,500 CIC Officers via the Defence Learning Network (https://dln-rad.forces.gc.ca)
- 7,500 Navy, Air and Army Cadets League members via HTML on a website
- 700 Volunteers of the Junior Canadian Ranger Program via HTML on DVD-R discs
Official duration for DND pay purposes - 6 hours, but approximately 24 contact hours.

### Roles/Responsibility
I designed, developed and implemented the awareness package with the Content Development Officer (CDO) and a six member team of writers and subject matter experts.   I trained the team how to develop content for online courseware and interactivity and provided a PowerPoint template for use during the design of the content.

### Approach
I developed with Trivantis Publisher v11, and published as SCORM modules for delivery on Saba LMS, and also exported as HTML files for Web/DVD distribution. 
This course contains the following attributes:
- controlled navigation
- pop-up pages and sub-sections of content
- table of contents “on-demand pop-up”
- choice of official language in single offering


### Instructions
Use the entitled HTML file “Open_First-Ouvrier_en_premier.html” which will launch the content for your review.
